    <a href="">WebMock 1</a> is still being developed and will be supported for quite some
    time. Once we're happy with WebMock 2.0 we'll retire the
    bblimke/webmock repo and move completely over to webmock/webmock.

  <p class="intro">
    We're working on some new features as part of WebMock 2.0 and hope to
    have something to show you very soon.
